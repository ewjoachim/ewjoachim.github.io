I gave another talk at my local Python meetup about Python packaging, and how to do it properly in 2017.

The new hype is to put everything in your `setup.cfg`. That's clean, that's beautiful, that's moderm and I :heart: it. For an example of how that looks for a "real" project, look at [Raincoat](https://github.com/novafloss/raincoat) !

Here's the French slides. Thanks again to [Twidi](https://twidi.com) for letting me use his work ! You can find the original slides [here](http://twidi.github.io/django-packaging-talk/) and the source [there](https://github.com/twidi/django-packaging-talk).
