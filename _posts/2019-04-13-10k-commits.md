[Twidi](https://twidi.com) and I dive into the challenges that arise when a Django project starts to become huge. This talk was presented at [DjangoCon Europe 2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu) in Copenhagen.

Django is extremely effective for creating a website quickly with top notch features out of the box. But in some codebases, after a while, new developments can become harder and harder.

In this talk, we'll examine some design decisions that have, and haven't, scaled successfully, in the hope that the next time you start your big scale Django project, you won't end up cursing your past self after three years.

Among the subjects we'll tackle:

- Third parties, the problems they bring and a few solutions;
- Where to put your business logic to keep your sanity;
- How to archiecture your code for fun and profit;
- Testing strategies for large projects
