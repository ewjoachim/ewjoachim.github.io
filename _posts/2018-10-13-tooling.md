One year after our [PyconFR packaging talk]({% post_url 2017-09-29-packaging-2 %}), we sat down again with [Twidi](https://twidi.com), and wonder what other aspect of tooling would be worth a talk. We couldn't decide, so we did them all :D

We gave this talk at PyConFr 2018 in Lille, and this time, we needed a gadget loving guide. So follow us on the steps of the world's most famous (and thus worst) secret agent.

Thank you, and happy tooling. Feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ewjoachim) if you have any feedback!
