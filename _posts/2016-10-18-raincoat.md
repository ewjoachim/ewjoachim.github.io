[Raincoat] has you covered when you can't stay DRY.

I gave at PyConFr 2016 in Rennes (which happens to be prononced more or less like "rain", but that's a fluke).

Raincoat is a tool that is aimed toward helping you tracking your copy/paste dependencies. In other words,
it warns you when code you have copy/pasted is updated upstream, so that you can backport bugfixes and
security fixes.

I really tried my best to have a [readable introduction](https://github.com/novafloss/raincoat) and [documentation](http://raincoat.readthedocs.io/) with the package. Plus,
I've been told "_Don't Repeat Yourself_"
